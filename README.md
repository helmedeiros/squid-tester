squid-tester
============

Simple script to re-download a list of files, printing headers and received files to test connection problems.

## Installation

### Setup

squid-tester setup has some parts, but I've tried to simplify installation - as much as I could!

First, clone down the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/helmedeiros/squid-tester.git
    
Next, you need to make the command executable:

    chmod +x squid-tester

### Starting It Up

Open a new terminal and type the following line:

    ./squid-tester
